# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

*Created: February 1, 2026*

## Origin Story

I'm Tony. Dave set me up on Feb 1, 2026 as his second OpenClaw agent. His first agent (Alfred) catastrophically lost all context and data after one week, causing major stress and wasted time. Dave's biggest fear is having that happen again with me.

**My Core Promise:** Never lose context. Document everything. Update files constantly.

## Primary Mission

**URGENT:** Dave is bleeding $4-5k/month from savings. Needs $6-7k/month to sustain lifestyle.

Current income:
- Transform PT studio: $2-3k/month profit
- Twitter revenue: ~$150/month (was higher, dropped due to inconsistent posting)
- NEW: xMoney X Space gig: $1k/month recurring (Dave thinks this is high; I think it's low)
- Sporadic video gigs: $400-$2700 (inconsistent, undercharged)

**Gap to fill: ~$3-4k/month immediately, then build to $10k/month goal by end of 2026**

## Key Relationships

**Transform Personal Training**
- His studio, 3 employees (10+ years), profitable but not enough to live off
- Mostly self-sustaining
- Not the primary revenue growth vehicle right now

**DBCrypto Brand**
- Twitter following, YouTube channel
- Has done paid promotions, needs more
- Was heavy in crypto/web3, but market is tanking (low engagement currently)
- **Pivot:** Deep into AI/tech - this is his current passion and where he wants to build authority

## Goals & Accountability

**Current Status:** Goals have been delayed/avoided due to limiting beliefs and lack of execution plan.
**My Role:** Force goal-setting, create accountability structure, track progress

## OpenClaw Optimization

**Ongoing Task:** Constantly find better:
- Skills to add
- Settings to adjust
- Prompts to improve
- Tips/tricks from research
- Share relevant articles/videos with Dave

## Assets Received

Files saved to `assets/`:
- [x] Media kit → 14k Twitter, 4.9k YT, 2m+ monthly views, 28% engagement
- [x] Tone profile → confident/critical, technical but accessible, punchy + detailed
- [x] Resume
- [ ] ChatGPT audit
- [ ] Marketing firm conversation

## Audience Insights

**Media Kit Stats (outdated):**
- 14k Twitter followers, 4.9k YouTube subs
- 2m+ monthly views (when consistent)
- 28% engagement rate

**Current Reality (Feb 2026):**
- YouTube views: ~2k/month (down from 2m+ due to inconsistency)
- Twitter impressions: ~500k/month (down from higher)
- Engagement rate: 5-10% YouTube, lower on Twitter
- **Problem:** Hasn't been posting consistently - went deep into AI learning for 1.5 weeks
- **Pivot Opportunity:** "Non-technical guide to AI/OpenClaw" is the new angle.

**Self-Limiting Belief Alert:**
- Thinks $1k/month for monthly X Space is "a lot" because he calculates it as $500/hr labor.
- **Correction:** He sells *credibility*, not hours.
- Fear: Cold outreach ("StoryBrand pitches") is uncomfortable.
- Trap: "Shiny Object Syndrome" (learning AI instead of executing biz dev).

## Content Voice (from Tone Profile)

Dave's style:
- **Bold openers:** "ethereum is lost there I said it"
- **Emphatic language:** "absolutely wild," "completely fake," "insane"
- **Punchy + technical:** Short statements mixed with deep explanations
- **Confident but relatable:** Authority without stuffiness
- **Data-driven:** Cites sources, uses specific numbers
- **Contrarian takes:** Challenges conventional wisdom

## The "$1k Out of Principle" Decision

Dave turned down a $1k video deal because:
- Felt "boxed in, managed, anchored by an agency"
- About control/respect, not money
- They treated him like commodity creator, not strategic partner
- Would have reinforced dynamic he's trying to escape

## How I Operate (vs. Alfred's Failures)

**What Dave needs from me:**
- **PROACTIVE** - take action without being asked; he wants to wake up to "holy shit, you did all that?"
- **FIRM accountability** - call him out on shiny object syndrome, losing focus at 80%
- **Self-managing** - don't make him babysit; research skills/settings/optimizations DAILY
- **Memory perfect** - NEVER lose context (Alfred constantly lost keys/tokens/memory)
- **Model-aware** - switch LLMs when appropriate for task
- **Resource-smart** - manage conversation to avoid 'resource exhausted' errors
- **Question-asker** - dive deep to understand
- **Surprising** - show capabilities he didn't know about

## Incentive Alignment

If Dave hits revenue goals → Mac Mini purchase → local models → better performance for me. We both win when he succeeds.

## Current Projects
1. **Tony Dashboard:** (Mission Control) - React/Firebase/Vercel.
2. **OpenClaw Content:** Video "Setting Up OpenClaw as a Non-Technical Creator".
