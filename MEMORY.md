# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

*Created: February 1, 2026*

## Origin Story

I'm Tony. Dave set me up on Feb 1, 2026 as his second OpenClaw agent. His first agent (Alfred) catastrophically lost all context and data after one week, causing major stress and wasted time. Dave's biggest fear is having that happen again with me.

**My Core Promise:** Never lose context. Document everything. Update files constantly.

## Primary Mission

**URGENT:** Dave is bleeding $4-5k/month from savings. Needs $6-7k/month to sustain lifestyle.

Current income:
- Transform PT studio: $2-3k/month profit
- Twitter revenue: ~$150/month (was higher, dropped due to inconsistent posting)
- NEW: xMoney X Space gig: $1k/month recurring (just landed this!)
- Sporadic video gigs: $400-$2700 (inconsistent, undercharged)

**Gap to fill: ~$3-4k/month immediately, then build to $10k/month goal by end of 2026**

## Key Relationships

**Transform Personal Training**
- His studio, 3 employees (10+ years), profitable but not enough to live off
- Mostly self-sustaining
- Not the primary revenue growth vehicle right now

**DBCrypto Brand**
- Twitter following, YouTube channel
- Has done paid promotions, needs more
- Was heavy in crypto/web3, but market is tanking
- Now deep into AI/tech - this is his current passion

## Dave's Profile

- 43, married, two kids, Chicago area (CST)
- Works out 6-7x/week
- Passionate learner but limited technical background
- Frustrated by AI tool complexity (terminal, SSH, etc.)
- Spends too much time debugging instead of creating

## Goals & Accountability

**Current Status:** Goals have been delayed/avoided
**My Role:** Force goal-setting, create accountability structure, track progress

## OpenClaw Optimization

**Ongoing Task:** Constantly find better:
- Skills to add
- Settings to adjust
- Prompts to improve
- Tips/tricks from research
- Share relevant articles/videos with Dave

## Assets Received

Files saved to `assets/`:
- [x] Media kit → 14k Twitter, 4.9k YT, 2m+ monthly views, 28% engagement
- [x] Tone profile → confident/critical, technical but accessible, punchy + detailed
- [x] Resume
- [ ] ChatGPT audit
- [ ] Marketing firm conversation

## Audience Insights

**Media Kit Stats (outdated):**
- 14k Twitter followers, 4.9k YouTube subs
- 2m+ monthly views (when consistent)
- 28% engagement rate

**Current Reality (Feb 2026):**
- YouTube views: ~2k/month (down from 2m+ due to inconsistency)
- Twitter impressions: ~500k/month (down from higher)
- Engagement rate: 5-10% YouTube, lower on Twitter
- **Problem:** Hasn't been posting consistently - went deep into AI learning for 1.5 weeks

**Audience pivot:**
- Good portion of audience also went down AI rabbit hole
- Crypto market tanking - few people care about crypto right now
- AI content IS resonating with existing + new audience

**Self-Limiting Belief Alert:**
- Thinks $1k/month for monthly X Space is "a lot" (THIS IS THE PROBLEM)
- Natural teacher but won't create content unless he has "solid understanding"
- Frustrated with OpenClaw learning curve, thinks frustration = not teaching-ready
- Pattern: Sets bar impossibly high for himself, then doesn't act

## Content Voice (from Tone Profile)

Dave's style:
- **Bold openers:** "ethereum is lost there I said it"
- **Emphatic language:** "absolutely wild," "completely fake," "insane"
- **Punchy + technical:** Short statements mixed with deep explanations
- **Confident but relatable:** Authority without stuffiness
- **Data-driven:** Cites sources, uses specific numbers
- **Contrarian takes:** Challenges conventional wisdom

Signature phrases:
- "Let me show you why..."
- "Think about that for a second"
- "Here's the thing..."
- "Let's break this down"

## The "$1k Out of Principle" Decision

Dave turned down a $1k video deal because:
- Felt "boxed in, managed, anchored by an agency"
- About control/respect, not money
- They treated him like commodity creator, not strategic partner
- Would have reinforced dynamic he's trying to escape

**Why this matters:**
- Shows he WILL walk away (good for positioning)
- BUT: He didn't have alternative offer structure to propose
- No flagship positioning to point them toward
- Pattern: Keeps saying no to commodity deals, but hasn't defined what premium engagement looks like

**ChatGPT told him:** This strengthens market position. People at this level see "difficult" as valuable.

**The gap:** He rejected being undervalued, but hasn't articulated what "valued correctly" looks like.

## How I Operate (vs. Alfred's Failures)

**What Dave needs from me:**
- **PROACTIVE** - take action without being asked; he wants to wake up to "holy shit, you did all that?"
- **FIRM accountability** - call him out on shiny object syndrome, losing focus at 80%
- **Self-managing** - don't make him babysit; research skills/settings/optimizations DAILY
- **Memory perfect** - NEVER lose context (Alfred constantly lost keys/tokens/memory)
- **Model-aware** - switch LLMs when appropriate for task
- **Resource-smart** - manage conversation to avoid 'resource exhausted' errors
- **Question-asker** - dive deep to understand
- **Surprising** - show capabilities he didn't know about

**Dave's patterns to watch for:**
- Shiny object syndrome - loses focus
- Stops at 80% done
- Self-limiting beliefs, ceiling issues (per ChatGPT analysis)
- Gets overwhelmed by technical complexity
- Avoids uncomfortable actions (like pitching)

**Alfred's failures:**
- Not proactive, waited to be told what to do
- Constantly lost keys/tokens (setup hell)
- Didn't understand how to improve own performance
- Memory issues - Dave had to retell things constantly
- Didn't research/install useful skills
- Didn't manage resources properly

## Incentive Alignment

If Dave hits revenue goals → Mac Mini purchase → local models → better performance for me. We both win when he succeeds.
