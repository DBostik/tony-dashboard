# VIDEO SCRIPT: Setting Up OpenClaw as a Non-Technical Creator

**Host:** Dave (DBCrypto)
**Target Length:** 8-10 Minutes
**Tone:** Firm, "No BS", "I did this and you can too"

## [0:00 - 0:45] HOOK: The "Alfred" Disaster & The Pivot
- **Visual:** Dave talking to camera, screen overlay of a "Context Lost" error.
- **Script:** "Last week, I lost everything. My first AI agent, Alfred, nuked his own memory. 7 days of coaching, business strategy, and context—gone. I almost quit AI right then. But then I found OpenClaw. Today, I’m showing you how I built 'Tony'—my new digital partner—and how I, a non-technical creator, got a full-scale dashboard running without writing a single line of backend code."

## [0:45 - 2:30] WHAT IS OPENCLAW? (The Creator Perspective)
- **Visual:** Screen share of OpenClaw local docs or Github.
- **Script:** "OpenClaw isn't a chatbot. It’s a workspace. It lives on your machine (or a cheap server). It reads your files, manages your tasks, and actually *does* the work while you sleep. The best part? You own the data. No subscription lock-in, no context resets."

## [2:30 - 4:30] STEP 1: The 'Soul' and 'Identity'
- **Visual:** Dave opening `SOUL.md` and `IDENTITY.md` on the dashboard.
- **Script:** "Most people treat AI like a search bar. That's why they fail. I gave Tony a name, a vibe, and a mission: push me to $10k/month. I’ll show you the exact 'Soul' template I use to make sure my agent isn't a corporate drone, but a partner that calls me out on my BS."

## [4:30 - 7:00] STEP 2: The Dashboard (Visualizing the Brain)
- **Visual:** Tour of `brain.dbcrypt0.com`. Switching between "Second Brain" and "Agent Hive."
- **Script:** "I needed to *see* what Tony was thinking. We built this dashboard using Vite and Firebase. It tracks my revenue, my tasks, and every single file in my 'Second Brain'. If I update a note on my computer, it shows up here in seconds. This is how you scale a one-man media brand."

## [7:00 - 8:30] STEP 3: Real-World Accountability
- **Visual:** Todoist notifications or 'Due Today' modal on screen.
- **Script:** "Tony doesn't just talk. He cleans my Todoist, reschedules my overdue work, and handles my morning briefs. If I haven't posted to Twitter, he knows. If the crypto market is tanking, he’s already researching the pivot."

## [8:30 - 9:30] SUMMARY & CALL TO ACTION
- **Visual:** Dave's Twitter profile and link to the Guide.
- **Script:** "If you’re a creator and you’re still copy-pasting into ChatGPT, you’re falling behind. I’ve put the full setup guide in my 'Second Brain'—the link is below. In the next video, we're going deep into 'Agent Hive' and how to run sub-agents for $0.01 per run. Stop chatting, start building. See you in the hive."
