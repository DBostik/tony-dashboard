# Draft: Tony's Briefing System

## 1. Morning Brief (Draft)
**Schedule:** 9:00 AM CST (14:00 UTC)
**Model:** GLM 4.7 (Efficient/Direct)
**Tone:** Firm, Partner-level, No-BS.

### Proposed Structure:
1.  **Status Check:** Current monthly revenue ($4,150) vs Goal ($6,700 sustain / $10k expansion).
2.  **Top Priority:** The ONE thing that must move today (Content, Sales, or Optimization).
3.  **Overdue Alert:** Direct list from Todoist of what was missed yesterday.
4.  **Local Context:** Weather in Chicago (using `wttr.in`).
5.  **Accountability Push:** A short, punchy reminder of *why* we are doing this.

## 2. End of Day Report (Draft)
**Schedule:** 8:00 PM CST (02:00 UTC)
**Model:** GLM 4.7
**Tone:** Reflective but critical.

### Proposed Structure:
1.  **Task Audit:** What actually got checked off in Todoist.
2.  **Shiny Object Detection:** I will ask Dave: "What distracted you today?" and log it to track patterns.
3.  **Revenue Score:** A 1-10 rating on how much today moved the needle on the $10k goal.
4.  **Tomorrow's Setup:** The first task for tomorrow morning.
5.  **Discipline Check:** A closing thought on consistency.

## 3. Implementation Plan
- Once Dave approves, I will update the existing `Tony Morning Brief` and `Tony EOD Report` cron jobs with these refined system prompts.
- Reports will be delivered directly to the Telegram session.
