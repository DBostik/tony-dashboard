**Theme:** Infrastructure & Resilience
**Focus:** Dashboard Build, Model Stabilization, & Security

### ✅ Major Accomplishments

    *   Preserved 100% of context/memory during the transition.
    *   Established "Compaction" protocol to manage token costs (~130k/turn).

2.  **Mission Control (Tony Dashboard) Built:**
    *   **Repo:** `tony-dashboard` created and deployed to Vercel.
    *   **Tech:** React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Firebase.
    *   **Features:**
        *   **Live Status:** Revenue tracking, uptime, model stats.

        *   **Mobile:** Fully responsive layout with hamburger menu and slide-over file viewer.

3.  **Accountability & Strategy:**
    *   **Pricing:** Re-framed the "$1k/month" mindset. It's not hourly work; it's **Trust Transfer**.
